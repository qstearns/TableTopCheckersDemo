# TableTop.JS

## A Demo game of Checkers using TableTop.JS

This project is intended to show a working game built with TableTop.JS however it does not show the steps used to create it. To get a better idea of how to create your own TableTop.JS game from scratch, check out our tutorials [here](https://github.com/andrewjmeier/TableTop.JS)

### How To Run

1. Clone the Repo using: `git clone https://github.com/qstearns/TableTopCheckersDemo.git`

2. cd into the directory `cd TableTopCheckersDemo`

3. Follow steps 9-12 [here] (https://github.com/andrewjmeier/TableTop.JS/blob/master/tutorials/markdown/setup.md)

4. `npm install webpack`

5. `npm run webpack`

6. Then in a new terminal window, `node server.js`

7. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to start playing checkers. If you open multiple tabs you can test out multiplayer.

8. You can make modifications to the files in the `checkers` directory to play around with a TableTop.JS game.

Happy Coding!
